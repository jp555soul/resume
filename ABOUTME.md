# About Me

The incredible true story of Jason Paul.  Best place to start is around 5 or 6, where I started Fencing as my main focus in life. The goal was to represent United States in the Olympics. As I continued my schooling, I was able to reach the milestones needed to obtain a college scholarship to The Ohio State University. While at university, I still maintained a heavy focus on fencing and the Olympics. I was able to become a National Champion, US team member, and NCAA Champion. Unfortunately, I was unable to represent the United States in the Olympics.

After deciding to relinquish the Olympics, my focus turned to my passions and curiosities, technology. My degree gave me a high level overview of various technologies used for mass communication. From hardwares used to software development, the tool of  web development peaked my interest. As my scholarship allowed for a 4 year term, I graduated with a Communication Technology degree. I spent 1 year working as a mechanic and taught myself a basic foundation based on front end development (and Flash at that time). I freelanced a couple of local company static websites and gain confidence with developing a workflow and library of knowledge. I then decided to move back home. 

After a few interviews, I started my software development career at Comcast Entertainment Group as a Web Developer, Skunkworks team. CEG development team comprised of 3 main teams totalling 75 devs: E! Online, G4tv, Style Network. There was a 4th small team comprised of 6 members, Skunkworks, which were allowed to work across all properties. As a member of that team, I was able to accelerate my learning curve across the whole internet stack. CEG and the particular team I was on allowed me to put my hands in the various codebases used. E! Online and Style Network were JSP based sites. My focus was on third party tool implementation (Twitter and Facebook - which were both rather new at that time), E! front end development, mobile development (WAP),  micro site development, and other various tasks. G4TV was a .net website where I assisted in the transition from single server pages to .net MVC framework. While working with the G4TV team, I gained a great appreciation for a love of mine, video games. I developed a desire to have my name in the credits of a game. After some financial disagreements, I transitioned my services to a smaller, more intimate team at 72andSunny.

72andSunny is an advertising agency comprised of 75 people total. The dev team was made up of 7 devs. 72 was a Ruby on Rails house with clients as Carl's Jr,  Nike, Air New Zealand, Bugaboo, 2K Sports, and other brands. While at 72andSunny I focused on the current (actually surprised by this) Carlâ€™s Jr front end design, New Zealand flash ads, and 2K Sports Facebook apps. After a management reorganization, I was lucky enough to be offered a unique opportunity at my current job Naughty Dog. 

Naughty Dog is a video game studio comprised of approximately 250 - 300 people. Naughty Dog had just come off of a rough relationship with an advertising agency and their frequency in developmental updates. So they decided to hire a web developer. I become that web developer. The code that I inherited was based in PHP.
