# Jason Paul

I'm a software and product developer by trade and by passion, but also a
well-rounded individual who pursues knowledge in a variety of fields and subjects. 
I'm seeking a position working with high-volume applications with unique technical challenges as well as a chance to contribute
in a meaningful way to product direction and strategy. I bring experience with
every level of the Internet application stack as well as an engaging
personality and eagerness to be very hands-on with all aspects of the process
from product design to back-end implementation.
