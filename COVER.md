I'm Jason, a Technology Consultant and Futurist based in LA with over a decade of software experience across the full range of the tech stack as well as timeline planning, site design and implementation, marketing, business development, workflow methodologies and more. 

I enjoy working with high-volume applications and tools development with unique technical challenges as well as a chance to contribute meaningfully to product direction and strategy. 

Though my background is based on doing a code, my experience is at every level of application stack from product design and customer-facing to back-end implementation.

I'm a Full-Stack engineer with experience working with variety of stacks. I'm not limited to any particular language of setup, let's just build.
